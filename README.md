# HTAssignment

This repository contains an analysis of climate data from Melbourne and Oxford to visualise rainfall patterns in the cities.

To run this analysis use the following commands with combine-data.R to combine the data sets and make-plot.R to create the plot based on the combined data:

```
Rscript src/combine-data.R
Rscript src/make-plot.R
```

The input data is in `data` and the results are in `out`.
